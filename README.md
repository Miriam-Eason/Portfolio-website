# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website project designed to showcase work, skills, and experience.

The UI design was created with [Ideogram.ai](https://ideogram.ai/), developed using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/), and refined with [Cursor](https://cursor.so/).



## Quick Start

​	1.	Install components using shadcn:

```
npx shadcn@latest add "https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_iNGiems3uOo?token=eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIn0..Y2XKhPsaLFGXMfgY.duv_sTybHSIsNfX0sAfjY6R6Gulu9g1KdntFrtY8mFkcTKRW603-15I4irs.35k0u8Q4Jwm0An0Lq-BcdA"
```



​	2.	Install project dependencies:

```
npm install
```



​	3.	Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Prompt

1. “Generate a responsive React front-end code for a portfolio website based on the following design:
	•	A Hero section with large centered text ‘Hi, I’m Qin Qi’ and subtext ‘Front-end Developer’, plus a stylish call-to-action button labeled ‘View My Work’.
	•	A Projects section displaying 3 project cards with a placeholder image, project title, and a short description (1-2 lines).
	•	A simple Contact section with an email icon and ‘Get In Touch’ text.



2. The page must be responsive (mobile and desktop).
   Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
   Use ShadCN UI components wherever appropriate (e.g., Button, Card).

3. The design should have a minimalist and fresh aesthetic with lots of white space, rounded corners, soft hover effects, and a soft color palette (white, soft blue, light gray).
   Ensure clean, professional code output with readable structure.”

## Experience

Just tried v0.dev — super impressed! It turned my design into clean React code with Tailwind and ShadCN in no time. Responsive out of the box, well-organized, and so easy to tweak. Honestly a game changer for anyone doing front-end work.
